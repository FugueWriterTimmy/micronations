  <header>Declaration of Independence of Contrapunctia</header>

  <main class="container">

    </div>

    <p><em>In the Year of Our Lord 2025, within the borders of a humble yet dignified estate, the People of this land — represented by their Founder — do solemnly proclaim the establishment of a free and sovereign micronation known henceforth as <strong>Contrapunctia</strong>.</em></p>

    <h2>Preamble</h2>
    <p>Recognizing the natural rights of all individuals to self-expression, creativity, and the pursuit of order through beautiful complexity, and affirming the sacred value of faith and knowledge, the People declare that:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Contrapunctia</strong> is, from this day forward, an independent micronation, existing for cultural, artistic, intellectual, and spiritual enrichment.</li>
      <li>No external authority shall interfere with the internal symbols, traditions, institutions, or ceremonial governance of Contrapunctia, except in matters where applicable real-world laws must necessarily be observed.</li>
      <li>The capital city shall be <strong>Nova Europa</strong>, seat of culture and governance.</li>
      <li>The national currency shall be the <strong>Zlaty</strong>.</li>
      <li>Contrapunctia shall be guided by the principles of faith, reason, and justice, upholding the ideals of creativity, community, and divine order.</li>
      <li>All citizens, visitors, pets, and all other living beings are to be treated with dignity and respect under the laws of this land.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Declaration</h2>
    <p>With full respect for the realities of the wider world and an honest acknowledgement that international recognition is not the measure of a nation's worth, we pronounce Contrapunctia a sovereign nation.</p>

    <h2>Ratification</h2>
    <p>This Declaration is ratified by the Founder of Contrapunctia and will stand as the foundational proclamation upon which the laws, rituals, and institutions of Contrapunctia will be built.</p>

    <div class="sig">
      <p>Signed,</p>
      <p><strong>The Founder of Contrapunctia</strong></p>
      <p>Nova Europa, 2025</p>
