  <header>Government Structure of Contrapunctia</header>

  <main class="container">
    </div>

    <p>Contrapunctia is a theocratic micronation founded on the principles of justice and order. Its governance is designed to balance ceremonial traditions with practical administration, ensuring that the cultural, spiritual, and civic needs of its citizens are met. The system emphasizes both hierarchical structure and community participation, reflecting the nation's values of creativity, music, and devotion to symbolic order.</p>

    <h2>Supreme Authority</h2>
    <p>The ultimate authority within Contrapunctia rests with the <strong>Founding Harmonist</strong>. This role encompasses spiritual guidance, interpretation of ceremonial laws, and oversight of national administration. The Founding Harmonist embodies the nation’s ideals and is responsible for issuing decrees, presiding over major ceremonies, and ensuring that the harmony of the state is preserved. While decisions are guided by tradition, the Founding Harmonist maintains the flexibility to adapt to new circumstances, maintaining both the symbolic and practical integrity of governance.</p>
    <p>The Founding Harmonist also serves as the chief judge in matters requiring arbitration between citizens, and has authority over the enactment and interpretation of all legal codes. The ceremonial authority of this position is further reinforced by the ability to appoint key advisors, assign honorary titles, and manage the national treasury in Aureus currency.</p>

    <h2>Departments and Roles</h2>
    <p>Contrapunctia’s administration is organized into departments that oversee specific areas of governance. Each department has a clearly defined mission and reports to the Founding Harmonist through the Council of Advisors.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Religious Affairs:</strong> Oversees all spiritual and ceremonial practices, ensuring that national rituals align with the nation’s guiding principles.</li>
      <li><strong>Culture and Education:</strong> Promotes the study of counterpoint, music, and other cultural arts, while organizing educational initiatives and national festivals.</li>
      <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Manages the Aureus treasury, trade, resource allocation, and ceremonial economic matters.</li>
      <li><strong>Public Order:</strong> Maintains citizen conduct, ceremonial decorum, and ensures peaceful resolution of disputes.</li>
      <li><strong>Foreign Relations:</strong> Handles symbolic diplomacy, correspondence with other micronations, and any external cultural collaborations.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Decision-Making Process</h2>
    <p>Major decisions are guided by both tradition and consultation. While the Founding Harmonist has ultimate authority, complex or controversial matters are discussed with the Council of Advisors to ensure harmony between ceremonial obligations and practical governance. Decisions affecting citizen participation, national ceremonies, or resource allocation follow a transparent process within this advisory framework.</p>
    <p>Daily governance, minor administrative decisions, and enforcement of symbolic laws are delegated to departmental heads, ensuring that each aspect of national life operates smoothly while upholding the foundational values of Contrapunctia.</p>

    <h2>Citizen Participation</h2>
    <p>Citizens are encouraged to actively participate in national projects, cultural programs, and ceremonial events. Although the nation is small, engagement is considered essential for maintaining harmony and nurturing the cultural and spiritual identity of Contrapunctia. Participation can take the form of creative contributions, advisory roles, or active involvement in festivals and national observances.</p>
    <p>Citizens are also empowered to propose initiatives and suggest enhancements to ceremonial practices or national programs. While final decisions rest with the Founding Harmonist and Council of Advisors, the nation values input that strengthens its social, cultural, and spiritual life.</p>
